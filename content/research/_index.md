The focus of our lab is on two main topics: (i) comparative genomics and (ii) genomics of DNA damage and repair. 

## Evolutionary Genomics

The vast amount of genomic data sets get harder to analyze day by day. Computational tool developers have been trying to catch up with the Next Generation Sequencing data accumulation. However, there is also a need to apply a biologist perspective to individual cases in order to achieve a precision we would need in moleculer medicine. We apply computational methods and develop approaches to understand how proteins work. We are primarily interested in determining a protein's **function**, what are its functional **partners** and what are the **importance** of each amino acid. We benefit from molecular evolution methods.

## DNA Damage and Repair

We will also be actively colloborating with [Aziz Sancar Lab](http://sancarlab.unc.edu) and analyze genomic damage and repair profiles under variety of conditions.
