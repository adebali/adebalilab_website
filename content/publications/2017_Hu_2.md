Nucleotide excision repair is a major DNA repair mechanism in all cellular organisms. In this repair system, the DNA damage is removed by concerted dual incisions bracketing the damage and at a precise distance from the damage. Here, we review the basic mechanisms of excision repair in Escherichia coli and humans and the recent genome-wide mapping of DNA damage and repair in these organisms at single-nucleotide resolution.
