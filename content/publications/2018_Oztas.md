Plants are exposed to numerous DNA-damaging stresses including the exposure to ultraviolet (UV) component of solar radiation. They employ nucleotide excision repair to remove DNA-bulky adducts and to help eliminate UV-induced DNA lesions, so as to maintain their genome integrity and their fitness. Here, we generated genome-wide single-nucleotide resolution excision repair maps of UV-induced DNA damage in Arabidopsis at different circadian time points. Our data show that the repair of UV lesions for a large fraction of the genome is controlled by the joint actions of the circadian clock and transcription by RNA polymerase II. Our findings reveal very strong repair preference for the transcribed strands of active genes in Arabidopsis, and 10 to 30% of the transcription-coupled repair is circadian time-dependent. This dynamic range in nucleotide excision repair levels throughout the day enables Arabidopsis to cope with the bulky DNA lesion-inducing environmental factors including UV.
