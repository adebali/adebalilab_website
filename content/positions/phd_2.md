title: "5 PhD Positions in Computational Genomis of DNA Damage and Repair"
draft: False
---


We invite applications to fill 5 Ph.D. positions. 

Successful candidates will join our team at Sabanci University working to understand the genome-wide inetractions between three-dimensional structure of genome and DNA repair. 

<!--more-->

The research requires an interest in the intersection of computational biology, molecular biology. A strong candidate would have expertise in one of these areas and an interest in learning about the other. While a broad range of backgrounds are suitable for this position, a PhD in bioinformatics or computational biology is desirable. High level coding in Python and/or R is a highly desired skill.

Exceptional applicants without a formal biological background are also encouraged to apply, particularly if they have interest in bioinformatics.

**Masters degree is not required** as long as you are eligible to apply for Ph.D. program directly after BS degree. We welcome and encourage international applications at Sabanci University.

The salary will be 4500TL per month for 12 months in a year. The students will also be provided tution waiver and free accomodation at student dormitories. Travel grants are generously available for national and international conferences.

The students will be given unlimited access to high performance clusters at Sabanci University as well as our lab servers. The laboratory will provide any equipment needed for individual research such as work stations.

We will have international collaborators from East Asia, Europe and North America. It will be possible for students to visit our collaborators for a short term to gain experience.

The start time will be **January 2020**.

Please send us your CV including the contact information of 3 references and a letter of interest outlining your background and research accomplishments. Single `pdf` is appreciated. Applications can be sent directly to [oadebali@sabanciuniv.edu](mailto:oadebali@sabanciuniv.edu). The preinquries can be made via e-mail or our [contact](/contact) page.
