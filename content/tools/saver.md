Single Amino acid Variant EvaoluatoR (SAVER) is a computational algorithm that benefts from a [proof of concept](/publication/2016_Adebali_1) that is specifically designed to predict the effects of amino acid substitutions in NPC1 gene on protein function. The web application interface is generated to reveal the amino acid substitution effect and corresponding position in a multiple sequence alignment.
