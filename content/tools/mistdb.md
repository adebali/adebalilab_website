Microbial Signal Transduction Database 3.0 serves genomic signal transduction profiles of bacteria and arhaea.

<!--more-->

MiST database hosts `~125000` prokaryotic genomes and their proteins full of pre-computed features. `Pfam` domains, low complexity regions, transmembrane domains,
`Agfam` domain hits and signal transduction categorizations are all included in the database. This is a colloborative work between [Zhulin Lab](http://u.osu.edu/zhulinlab/) at [Ohio State University](http://ohio-state.edu), [Caltech](http://caltech.edu) and [Adebali Lab](http://adebalilab.org) at [Sabanci University](http://sabanciuniv.edu/en).
