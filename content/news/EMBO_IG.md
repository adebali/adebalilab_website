Our group will receive a research funding for 3 to 5 years. Moreover, we will be an active member of the [Young Investigators Programme](http://embo.org/funding-awards/young-investigators).

Our project will focus on the evolution of G protein-coupled receptors. We will investigate the evolutionary events shaping up the largest mammalian receptor family. 

With the new grant we will recruite graduate students, a technician and a postdoc. Please see the open [positions](/positions).
